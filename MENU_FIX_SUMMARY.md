# AWS CloudBurst - Menu Fix Summary

## üêõ Issue Identified
The AWS CloudBurst game had non-functional menu options:
- **High Scores** option was selectable but didn't work
- **Controls** option was selectable but didn't work
- Players could only access Play and Quit options

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Game State
```python
class GameState(Enum):
    # ... existing states ...
    CONTROLS = "controls"  # Added new state
```

### 2. Fixed Menu Input Handling
Updated `_handle_menu_input()` to handle all menu options:
```python
elif key == pygame.K_RETURN or key == pygame.K_SPACE:
    if self.selected_menu_option == 0:  # Play
        self._start_new_game()
    elif self.selected_menu_option == 1:  # High Scores
        self.state = GameState.HIGH_SCORE
    elif self.selected_menu_option == 2:  # Controls
        self.state = GameState.CONTROLS
    elif self.selected_menu_option == 3:  # Quit
        self.running = False
```

### 3. Added Event Handling for New States
```python
elif self.state == GameState.HIGH_SCORE:
    if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE or event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
        self.state = GameState.MENU
elif self.state == GameState.CONTROLS:
    if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE or event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
        self.state = GameState.MENU
```

### 4. Created New UI Methods

#### High Scores Screen (`draw_high_scores()`)
- Displays current high score
- Shows AWS certification achievement levels:
  - AWS Novice (1,000+ points)
  - Cloud Practitioner (5,000+ points)
  - Solutions Architect (15,000+ points)
  - DevOps Engineer (30,000+ points)
  - Cloud Expert (50,000+ points)
- Visual indicators for achieved vs. unachieved levels

#### Controls Screen (`draw_controls()`)
- Complete game controls reference
- Gameplay instructions and tips
- AWS services information
- Power-up explanations
- Professional layout with clear sections

### 5. Added Rendering Logic
```python
elif self.state == GameState.HIGH_SCORE:
    self.ui.draw_high_scores(self.screen, self.high_score)
elif self.state == GameState.CONTROLS:
    self.ui.draw_controls(self.screen)
```
