        intensity = i / self.radius
        color = tuple(int(c * intensity) for c in AWS_ORANGE)
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, color, (center_x, center_y), i)
    
    # Enhanced Q Developer branding
    q_text = font.render("Q", True, AWS_WHITE)
    ai_text = ai_font.render("AI", True, AWS_WHITE)
    
    # AWS branding dots around perimeter
    for dot_x, dot_y in dot_positions:
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, AWS_WHITE, (int(dot_x), int(dot_y)), 1)
```

        pygame.draw.rect(screen, gradient_color, (rect.left, rect.top + i, rect.width, 1))
    
    # AWS smile curve (iconic logo element)
    smile_points = []
    for i in range(11):
        angle = math.pi * i / 10
        x = center_x - 30 + i * 6
        y = center_y + 3 - int(3 * math.sin(angle))
        smile_points.append((x, y))
    pygame.draw.lines(screen, AWS_WHITE, False, smile_points, 2)
    
    # AWS text branding
