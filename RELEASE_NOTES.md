# AWS CloudBurst - Release Notes

## Version 1.1.0 - Power-Up System Overhaul (2024-07-09)

### 🚀 Major Features & Fixes

#### Power-Up System Complete Rewrite
All 6 power-ups are now fully functional with proper activation/deactivation logic:

- **🔴 Laser Paddle** - Press SPACE to fire red lasers that destroy blocks
- **🔵 Slow Motion** - Reduces ball speed by 30% for precision control  
- **⚪ Shield** - Creates protective barrier above paddle (3 hits)
- **🟢 Paddle Extend** - Increases paddle width by 50%
- **🟠 Multi-Ball** - Spawns 2 additional balls
- **🟡 Score Multiplier** - Doubles all points earned

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Game Crashes**: Power-up pickup no longer causes crashes due to undefined paddle_rect
- **Fixed Laser Always Firing**: Laser now only works when power-up is active (proper condition check)
- **Fixed Missing Implementations**: Slow Motion and Shield now fully functional with complete logic

#### Gameplay Improvements  
- **Increased Power-Up Drop Rate**: From 15% to 25% for better game flow
- **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: Shield shows damage state with color changes
- **Improved Game Balance**: More frequent and meaningful power-ups

### 🔧 Technical Changes

#### New Classes Added
- `Laser` - Projectile system for laser paddle power-up with collision detection
- `Shield` - Protective barrier system with hit points and visual feedback

#### Enhanced Existing Classes
- `Ball` - Added slow motion support with `effective_dt` calculation
- `Game` - Complete power-up state management and collision detection
- `PowerUp` - Improved drop rates and activation logic

#### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed collision detection order to prevent crashes
- Added proper cleanup for inactive game objects  
- Enhanced error handling for power-up activation
- Added missing `Ball.get_rect()` method for collision detection

### 🎮 Gameplay Changes

- Shield durability: 3 hits before destruction
- Slow motion: 30% speed reduction
- Paddle extend: 50% width increase

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Critical Fixes
- **Power-up pickup crash** - Fixed undefined `paddle_rect` variable by moving definition earlier
- **Laser always firing** - Fixed condition check from `in self.active_powerups` to `> 0`
- **Missing Ball.get_rect()** - Added collision detection method for shield interactions

#### Gameplay Fixes
- **Slow motion not working** - Implemented proper ball speed modification in Ball.update()
- **Shield not appearing** - Complete shield implementation with collision and visual feedback
- **Low power-up frequency** - Increased drop rate from 15% to 25% for better experience

### 📋 Files Changed
