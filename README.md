## Development

### Code Structure

The game follows Python best practices with:

- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation throughout
- **Docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation for all classes and methods
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of file operations and pygame events
- **Constants**: Configuration values clearly defined at module level
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular design with single responsibility principle

### Customization Options

#### Difficulty Adjustment
Modify these constants in the code:
```python
BALL_INITIAL_SPEED = 300        # Starting ball speed
BALL_SPEED_INCREASE = 0.05      # Speed increase per level (5%)
BALL_MAX_SPEED = 600           # Maximum ball speed
PADDLE_SPEED = 400             # Paddle movement speed
```

#### Visual Customization
AWS color palette can be adjusted:
```python
AWS_ORANGE = (255, 153, 0)      # Primary brand color
AWS_DARK_BLUE = (35, 47, 62)    # Background color
AWS_GREEN = (122, 161, 22)      # Success/power-up color
```

#### Game Balance
Power-up and scoring can be tuned:
```python
# Power-up drop chance (15% default)
if destroyed and block.block_type.value[1] >= 2 and random.random() < 0.15:

# Score multiplier values
TIER_1_POINTS = 10
TIER_2_POINTS = 25
TIER_3_POINTS = 50
```
